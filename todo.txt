flac:

- get our own tests in order
- add circleci (but not tox) test for cookiecutter tests
- change logging paradigm to assume deployment with systemd?
    - https://caddyserver.com/docs/logging
- Should be able to use it without a db but sqlalchemy_utils is in the top-level imports.  We'd
    have to conditionally include the DB cli commands.
- Shouldn't bake sentry into the command line.


cookie cutter:

- keg cc - tox.ini: review diffs
- gunicorn isn't in any requirements so the cli command doesn't work
- no loading on relationships by default
- query_with()
- query profiling in tests
- improve ability to set child/parent kwargs in testing_create(), like blender
- rename testing_create() to fake
- tox doesn't work when sqlalchemy isn't installed b/c of calling the `db` cli command.  Seems
  like I should think through this more...how to make db optional.  Additional customization
  in flask-cc.py?
- flask-sqlalchemy dependency - see ext.py
- check doist app for project updates
- use rust wsgi server for production
- take reqs compiliation logic from zulu
- code is not formatted or linted
- get rid of .flake8
- get rid of MANIFEST.in
- use pip-audit instead of safety
