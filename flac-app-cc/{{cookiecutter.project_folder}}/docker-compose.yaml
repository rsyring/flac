# Docker Notes
# ============
# - `docker-compose up`: bring up containers
# - `docker-compose up -d`: same, but run in background/daemon mode
# - `docker-compose down`: bring down containers started with `-d`
# - `docker ps`: show running containers
# - `docker ps -a`: show all containers
# - `docker-compose exec <container name> /bin/bash`: get shell in app container
# - `docker images`
# - `docker rmi <image name>`
# - `docker stop $(docker ps -aq)`: stop all running containers
# - `docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)`: remove all stopped containers
# Can use a .env to customize port mappings, but that will only work when running docker-compose in
# the same directory as this file.  You can also use an override file if desired.
