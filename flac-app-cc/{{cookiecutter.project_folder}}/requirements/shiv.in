# Match the versions that common will use.

# Needed for the cleanup in our shiv preamble.  If not using the development version of flac,
# then this could get put into common.in and this file cant get removed.  In that case, you'd also
# want to edit:
#
#   1. compile.py: remove sed replacement (shiv.txt won't exist anymore)
#   2. shiv/build: change requirements file to common.txt
#
#  TODO: replace with pypi name once it gets published there
